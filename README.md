# Chinese Character (Traditional) Scene Text

This code is used for the competition [繁體中文場景文字辨識競賽－進階賽：繁體中文場景文字辨識](https://tbrain.trendmicro.com.tw/Competitions/Details/16). The competition is about scene text recognition in Taiwan (Traditional Chinese). This code included [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) for text detection and [EfficientNet-PyTorch](https://github.com/lukemelas/EfficientNet-PyTorch) for Chinese character image classification. The dataset for text detection included [Google Landmarks Dataset V2](https://github.com/cvdfoundation/google-landmark) as background image while for image classification included [Single_char_image_generator](https://github.com/rachellin0105/Single_char_image_generator) as character generator. Both the dataset also included the data given by the organiser.
